            <h2 style="font-family:epilogue-sansserif">“more simplicity, more productivity” </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px; font-family:epilogue-sansserif">We started this venture, Excel Square with a goal of providing simple tools and solutions that would make everyday life easier for professionals across the world. The focus is on enhancing productivity through simplicity. Our experience of the fact that, complex problems often just need a stroke of simplicity for the solution, keeps us on the lookout of areas which typically have nagging problems or areas in which we can create a big value add through the introduction of simple and effective utilities. The first step towards this was the creation of X-TrackAmaze, an extremely effective planning tool for a professional whose plate is full of “things to be done” at all times. Its easy interface, its utility, its effectiveness, attractive pricing, all these won the hearts of thousands of users worldwide. In fact, across its versions, the number of downloads of X-TrackAmaze had exceeded 200,000. Building on top of this success, we have launched PlanDeer, which is the next avatar of X-TrackAmaze. While PlanDeer carries the heart of X-TrackAmaze, it additionally includes several features and functionalities to increase the agility and productivity of the tool. We have strived hard to make the usability of PlanDeer a notch above that of X-TrackAmaze, which itself had high focus on Usability.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px; font-family:epilogue-sansserif">We firmly believe that, it is only when we enable YOU, as our customer to excel, we can excel, and hence provide meaning to our identity that is called Excel Square! We strongly feel that our belief, “more simplicity, more productivity” would help enable us advance towards our goal.</p>
